Generate spacecoin addresses right from your browser.

Download from the link below, and then open the index.html file.

It will open in your browser just like a normal site.

It's recommended to disconnect your internet before opening the index.html file and generating addresses, to further protect your security.

The SpacePaperWallet provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded JavaScript/CSS/Images. The JavaScript is readable, not minified and contains no XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX).

The benefit of this technique is you can load the JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being loaded.


# User Notes:
 1) To print QRCode in IE8 you must enable the "Print Background Colors and Images" checkbox on the "Page Setup" screen.
 2) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.
 3) Requires IE8+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.
 4) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.
 5) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore they might record the private key you generated.
 6) Art Wallet does not work properly in IE8 due to CSS limitations.
